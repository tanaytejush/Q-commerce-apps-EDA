A Deep Dive into the Delivery Performance, Customer Sentiment, and Platform Efficiency of India's Top Instant Delivery Apps

Project Overview
In the age of 10-minute delivery promises, instant ecommerce platforms like Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, and JioMart are transforming consumer habits. But behind the scenes, how well are they really performing?

This project analyzes 100,000 real-world delivery records from top platforms to uncover what affects delivery success, customer satisfaction, and refund behaviors. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, we performed detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain actionable insights.

What This Project Covers:
Cleaned and explored delivery data across platforms.

Performed univariate and bivariate analysis.

Conducted sentiment analysis using TextBlob.

Visualized trends across platforms, categories, and feedback.

Derived actionable business insights.

Key Insights from the Data:

 1. Delivery Performance
Average delivery time across all platforms: ~29.5 minutes.

13.7% of orders were delayed, often leading to poor ratings and refund requests.

Swiggy Instamart and Blinkit outperformed JioMart in delivery efficiency and consistency.

 2. Customer Sentiment & Ratings
Most feedback was either very positive or very negative â€” neutral feedback was rare.

Delayed orders had a strong correlation with negative sentiment and low service ratings.

Average service rating: ~3.2/5 across platforms.

 3. Refund Behavior
A surprising 46% of orders had refund requests.

Higher refund rates were linked to delayed deliveries, high order values, and negative feedback.

Categories like fruits and dairy saw more refund complaints, indicating packaging or freshness issues.


Business Implications:

While these platforms are improving speed and convenience for consumers, the data tells a deeper story:

Small local businesses and grocery shops are at risk. With platforms offering deep discounts and near-instant service, neighborhood stores struggle to match the convenience and tech infrastructure.

Efficiency matters more than speed. Fast deliveries mean little if quality is poor or items are missing.

Platforms that balance speed with accuracy and customer care will see better retention and lower refund losses.
